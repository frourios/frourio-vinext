# Cookies

Use method-level `cookies` to validate incoming cookies and `res[status].cookies` to declare response cookie commands. Read [add-endpoint.md](add-endpoint.md) for the endpoint creation workflow.

## Define the cookie behavior in frourio.ts

```typescript
import type { FrourioSpec } from '@frourio/vinext';
import { z } from 'zod';

const themeSchema = z.enum(['light', 'dark']);

export const frourioSpec = {
  get: {
    cookies: z.object({ theme: themeSchema.optional() }),
    res: { 200: { body: z.object({ theme: themeSchema }) } },
  },
  post: {
    body: z.object({ theme: themeSchema }),
    res: {
      200: {
        cookies: {
          theme: {
            command: 'set',
            value: themeSchema,
            options: { path: '/', sameSite: 'lax', maxAge: 3600 } as const,
          },
          oldTheme: { command: 'delete', options: { path: '/' } },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  delete: {
    res: {
      204: { cookies: { theme: { command: 'delete', options: { path: '/' } } } },
    },
  },
} satisfies FrourioSpec;
```

Cookie names are the keys of the response `cookies` object. `value` is a Zod schema for `command: 'set'`; `command: 'delete'` has no value schema. Options follow Vinext `ResponseCookie` options, excluding `name` and `value`, and can include `path`, `domain`, `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite`, `maxAge`, `expires`, `partitioned`, and `priority`. `expires` is available only for `set`, matching the options accepted by Vinext `delete()`. Match Path and Domain when deleting a cookie that was set with those attributes. Deletion delegates to Vinext `response.cookies.delete()` with the declared options. Frourio preserves `maxAge` when specified and adds no `Max-Age` attribute when it is omitted. Vinext sets `expires` to the Unix epoch for deletion, then recalculates it from `maxAge` if that value is nonzero. A positive `maxAge` therefore retains an empty-valued cookie until it expires.

Request cookies are decoded strings passed to Zod, just like request headers. Use `z.coerce.number()` or `z.stringbool()` when a request cookie should become a number or boolean. For example, `z.coerce.number().int().optional()` allows a missing numeric cookie. `z.coerce.boolean()` treats the string `'false'` as true; use `z.stringbool()` for textual booleans. Invalid cookies, including missing required cookies, return 422 before the controller runs.

## Generate and implement the route

Run `npx frourio-vinext` after updating the spec. Implement `route.ts` using the generated `createRoute`:

```typescript
import { createRoute } from './frourio.server';

export const { GET, POST, DELETE } = createRoute({
  async get({ cookies }) {
    return { status: 200, body: { theme: cookies.theme ?? 'light' } };
  },
  async post({ body }) {
    return { status: 200, cookies: { theme: body.theme } };
  },
  async delete() {
    return { status: 204 };
  },
});
```

The controller returns only the values for `set` commands. The generated server validates them and applies the options and deletion commands for the returned status. Do not return commands, options, or values for `delete` entries. A response containing only deletions needs no `cookies` return property. Declare cookie operations for each response status that needs them.

Optional value schemas produce optional properties in the returned `cookies` object. A value that parses to `undefined` sends no cookie; it does not delete an existing cookie. Numbers and booleans are validated before being serialized as strings, and Zod transformations apply before serialization. Invalid response values return 500 with no cookies from the response spec applied.

## Clients and OpenAPI

The generated client has no `cookies` request argument or parsed response cookies property. Browser clients send and receive cookies through Fetch, using `init: { credentials: 'include' }` when needed. Browsers do not expose `Set-Cookie` to JavaScript, and `httpOnly` cookies cannot be read through `document.cookie`. For Node.js tests, call the route handler directly and inspect `res.cookies` or `res.headers.getSetCookie()`. Read [testing.md](testing.md) for test patterns.

OpenAPI emits request cookies as `in: cookie` parameters and response cookies as a `Set-Cookie` header with an array of example header values. Each array entry represents a separate header. Examples use the spec's inferred types: literal and enum values are preserved, while broad types and computed dates use representative values. Use `as const` on options when examples should retain literal strings and numbers. Regenerate with `npx frourio-vinext-openapi` after changing the spec.
